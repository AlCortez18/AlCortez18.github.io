         <h2> Where Im From</h2>
         <p>
              I was born here in San Jose and I was raised by my parents<br> and godparents, but my godparents raised me most since my parents do<br> no speak English and mostly do not know the ways of America. They<br> still did a good job for always being there for me no matter what.
                  </p> 
              
         <h2> What I am doing right now</h2>
         <p>   
            Right now I am working hard as a student at Alpha Cindy<br>
            Avitia to achieve success in high school, so I can go to<br> 
            a great college in the future and be very successful in<br> life and not be like my dad working for everyday in his life since he<br> knows that I can have a better life than he has and he and the rest of my<br> family believe in me.
                </p>
